Classified training of the GNB classifier
which is a function that associates one of the values ​​with each vector in the characteristic space.
For training there are two sample files one for train and one for test where each sample is a 28x28 square matrix representing an image of an item of clothing.
I was able to reach a classification level of 91 percent after using the training file, and 90 percent after using the test file.
all of the function i wrote were a part from a course i did which is called mathematics for machine learning.
